### PART 1

# println("Hello world! Julia seems very fun!")

# Here we can see that the language is dynamic, i.e. we don't have to define what data type the variable my_answer is
#my_answer = 42
#typeof(my_answer) # becomes an int

#my_pi = 3.14159
#typeof(my_pi) # becomes a float

# Exercise 1.1
# Look up docs for the convert function


# Exercise 1.2
# Assign 365 to a variable named days. Convert days to a float and assign it to variable days_float

# days = 365;
# days_float = convert(Float64, days)

# x = parse(Int64, "1")
# typeof(x)
